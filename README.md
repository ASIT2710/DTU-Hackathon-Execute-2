## AWS Shenanigans
**Note:** If `elasticache` is in private subnet
- Lambda function needs to be inside vpc and must be associated with privates subnets same as `elasticache`
- AWS VPC endpoints needs to be setup for - `SQS` & `DynamoDB`, since requests for these services travels through internet
- Environment variables (Key: Value), needs to be set for lambda functions:
```shell
ACCESS_KEY_ID:	---
QUEUE_URL:	https://---.fifo
REDIS_ENDPOINT:	redis://---.aps1.cache.amazonaws.com:6379
REGION:	ap-south-1
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:	---
```
- Modify config: timeout to 30seconds at least, Memory to 256mb
- Add follwing policies to the role (not ideal setup, just a shotgun approach):
```shell
AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole-64...ef	(already exist, add the remaining ðŸ‘‡)
AmazonSQSFullAccess
AmazonElastiCacheFullAccess
AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole
AdministratorAccess
AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole
AWSLambdaInvocation-DynamoDB
AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
```
